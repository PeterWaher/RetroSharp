# RetroSharp

**RetroSharp** or **Retro#** is a C# library that makes learning to develop fun and easy by creating a development 
environment mimicking early development environments (retro), while maintaining the benefits of a modern language
like C#.

**RetroSharp** relies on [OpenTK](http://www.opentk.com/) for OpenGL rendering. It can be downloaded directly from
their site. A binary file is also available in [Binaries folder](Binaries/OpenTK/Release) in this project. 
*RetroSharp* also relies on [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/) for audio-output. An installation file for OpenAL
for Windows can also be found in the [Binaries folder](Binaries/OpenAL).
